            <p class="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">C is a general-purpose programming language created by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Laboratories in 1972. It is a very popular language, despite being old. C is strongly associated with UNIX, as it was developed to write the UNIX operating system.C is a general-purpose high level language that was originally developed by Dennis Ritchie for the Unix operating system. It was first implemented on the Digital Eqquipment Corporation PDP-11 computer in 1972. The Unix operating system and virtually all Unix applications are written in the C language.What is C and its importance?
                C is called as a robust language, which has so many built-in functions and operations, which can be used to write any complex program. Generally, we use to call C as a middle level language. Because, the 'C' compiler combines the capabilities of an assembly language with the features of a high-level language C is the only programming language that exists for such a long period and still it is widely used. C is the basis of many other programming languages like C++, Java, JavaScript, Go, C#, PHP, Python, Perl, C-shell and many more to C is intresting from that languages.</p>
